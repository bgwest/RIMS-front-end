1. Start the frontend environment by executing the ```npm run watch``` command in your terminal.
  - If done correctly, a new browser window will open with the application, and the following message should appear in your terminal: 
     
        ```info: Server is on at PORT: <portNumber>```

- Once you are on the dashboard you will see not only the table(s) with the sub-assemblies, but you will also be able to create new parts and sub-assemblies by clicking the appropriate links. 
- When you are creating a sub assembly, take note of the very bottom field. This is the sub-assembly ID, and you will use that number to add parts to that sub-assembly on the part creation page.

- To add a part, you can click the link in the top left of the screen. This will take you to the part creation page. Remember the ID of the sub-assembly you created? Great! Did you forget it? That's OK, it displays on the dashboard as well.
- To link your new part to your newly created sub-assembly, enter it in the first field on the part creation page.
- That's it! There is no step three.
